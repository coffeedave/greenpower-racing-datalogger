To connect the components in the circuit, follow these steps:

Power Connections:

Connect the 3.3V pin of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (instance ID: ff53fdda-9d91-426a-9ad0-f3b6512c9fc5) to pin1 of the Resistor (instance ID: cd6e7508-a622-47a3-819b-1c5927e4ce0d).
Connect pin2 of the Resistor to the Power pin of the DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor (instance ID: c7eb71cc-522d-43ba-8a78-eb09945f7313).
Ground Connections:

Connect the Ground pin of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to the Ground pin of the DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor.
Data Connection:

Connect the Data pin of the DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor to GPIO 4 of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
